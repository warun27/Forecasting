Airlines Data

Final model chosen is Multiplicative additive seasonality as the RMSE is 10.42 and is the least. Number of Dummy values created is 12, 
however dummy variables used is 11 as if we know the value of all 11 Months, the value of 12th month becomes obvious. For eg - if Jan to Nov
is all 0, then Dec will be 1 and if any month between Jan to Nov is 1, then dec will be 0.

Also, i have tried creating all the possible models - Linear model, Exponential model, quadratic model, Additive Seasonality model, 
additive seasonality with quadratic trend, multiplicative seasonality, multiplicative seasonality with additive seasonality.

However, the line graph of the Passengers data set show that there is trend and seasonality in the data. Seasonality can be both additive and multiplicative as per me. 

Hence Additive Seasonality with Quadratic trend and Multiplicative additive seasonality should be the best option.
